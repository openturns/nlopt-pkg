Comment:
 NLopt combines several free/open-source nonlinear optimization
 libraries by various authors.  See the COPYING, COPYRIGHT, and README
 files in the subdirectories for the original copyright and licensing
 information of these packages.
 .
 The compiled NLopt library, i.e. the combined work of all of the
 included optimization routines, is licensed under the conjunction of
 all of these licensing terms.  Currently, the most restrictive terms
 are for the code in the "luksan" directory, which is licensed under
 the GNU Lesser General Public License (GNU LGPL), version 2.1 or
 later (see luksan/COPYRIGHT).
 .
 That means that the compiled NLopt library is governed by the terms of
 the LGPL.
 Other portions of NLopt, including any modifications to the
 abovementioned packages, are licensed under the standard "MIT License".

 The StoGO source code on the authors' web site has no copyright or
 license information, but I (Steven G. Johnson) contacted the author
 K. Madsen for clarification and he gave me permission to distribute
 it under the MIT license above.  See the correspondence below:

 The MIT licence is ok with me, and so is your copyright suggestion.

 Thanks so much for your response!
 .
 To be open source it needs some specific open-source license to specify
 the permissions in legal terms.  The simplest open-source license is
 probably the MIT license, is this okay?
 .
 http://opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php
 .
 Also, I need to know who the authors are for the copyright statement. 
 Should I list it as:
            Copyright (c) 1998 by S. Zertchaninov and K. Madsen ?
 .
 Thanks again!  I will definitely cite it if I publish any results based
 on StoGO!  (It's one of the few public global-optimization programs that
 is able to exploit gradient information.)
 .
 Regards,
 Steven G. Johnson
